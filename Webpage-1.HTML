<H2><P>The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the 
name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light 
seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually 
distinguished by the naked eye. From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a
 band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei
 first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.
 Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained 
all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the
 astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin 
Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</H2></P>

<H2><P>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible 
diameter of 150-200,000 light-years, an increase from traditional estimates 
of 100,000 light-years. Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter disk, 
also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2
 million light-years.</H2></P>
<BR><H2>
It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars and at least that number of 
planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 
light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, 
one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust.<BR></H2>
<H2> 
The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more
bars that radiate from the bulge. The galactic center is an intense radio source
known as Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million 
solar masses.<BR></H2>
