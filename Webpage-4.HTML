A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is 
massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to 
cause thermonuclear fusion, and – according to the International Astronomical
 Union but not all planetary scientists – has cleared its neighbouring region of
 planetesimals.<IMG SRC="SOLAR SYSTEM5.GIF" ALIGN="RIGHT"><BR><BR>
The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, 
and religion. Apart from Earth itself, five planets in the Solar System are often
 visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as 
divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human
 perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate
 objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted 
a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is
 controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on
 where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered
 before 1950 remain "planets" under the current definition, some celestial 
bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar 
asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that 
were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer 
viewed as planets under the current definition of planet.<BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="SOLAR SYSTEM3.GIF"></CENTER>
