A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
 nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—
can escape from it.[1] The theory of general relativity predicts that a
 sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
<BR>
The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the 
event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the 
fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to general
 relativity it has no locally detectable features.[4] In many ways, a black hole 
acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[5][6] Moreover, quantum
 field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking 
radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely 
proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a
 kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to 
observe directly.

Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first
 considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. 
The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black
 hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a 
region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David 
Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity
; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic 
prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell
 Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects 
as a possible astrophysical reality.<IMG SRC="BH.GIF" WIDTH="500PX" ALIGN="RIGHT"><BR>

Black holes of stellar mass form when very massive stars collapse at the 
end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow 
by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and 
merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of 
solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black 
holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.
<BR>
The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with
 electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black 
hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, 
some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a 
supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly
 before being "swallowed."[8] If there are other stars orbiting a black hole,
 their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. 
Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as 
neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar 
black hole candidates in binary systems, and established that the radio
 source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains 
a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.
