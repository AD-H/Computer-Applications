<H2><P>WHAT IS UNIVERSE?<BR>
The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time and their contents,
 including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.
 The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the 
development of the universe. According to estimation of this theory, space and
 time emerged together 13.799Â±0.021 billion years ago, and the universe has
 been expanding ever since. While the spatial size of the entire universe is
 unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, 
which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter.
<BR>
The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient
 Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the
 center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations 
led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the 
center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation,
 Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's
 laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.<BR>SOURCE-WIKIPEDIA<BR></H2>
