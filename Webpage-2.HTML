<P>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
 the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that
 orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder
 being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
 Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are 
larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.<IMG SRC="SOLAR SYSTEM.JPG" WIDTH="450PX" ALIGN="RIGHT">

The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse
 of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass
 is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. 
The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial
 planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets 
are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. 
The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed
 mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and 
Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively
 high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, 
such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular 
orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</H2></P>
