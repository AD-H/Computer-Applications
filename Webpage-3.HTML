<P>A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of
 plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. 
Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but due to their
 immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky.
 The most prominent stars are grouped into constellations and asterisms,
 and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have 
assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide 
standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an 
estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from 
Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of 
material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace
 amounts of heavier elements. The total mass of a star is the main factor
 that determines its evolution and eventual fate. For most of its active life, 
a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core,
 releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into 
outer space. At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar 
Remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or, if it is sufficiently massive, a 
black hole.</H2></P>
